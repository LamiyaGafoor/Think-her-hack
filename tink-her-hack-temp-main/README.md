### Project Description
[It helps 2 friends keep a journal for letting each other know about each others whereabouts. It also has features of storing their favourites images and videos througha google drive. It also consists of a bucket-list they wish to fullfill.]

### The Problem statement
[This project is built by two friends who are about to be drifted apart after 3years of staying together as one is going to pursue her masters in Calicut and other in Malaysia. They have the fear of not knowing each others whereabouts. They dont know if they will be able to break the time barrier and let each other know about their stories or their important moments of life.]

### The Solution
[We are solving this issue using the 'Duo Journal'. It has features of letting them both write a journal whenever they wish and the other person can access it and read it. The two users are named 'Elsa' and 'Anna' This way they can both write the journal for themselves and be available to read their best friends journal too. They both can also view their old photos and videos as their memories. They also have bucket list which they hope to complete some day in future. ]
